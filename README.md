# Shapes
A java programme that allows users to enter number of sides to generate a shape and colour to fill it in.


This is a Java program that creates shapes on a user interface. The user interface includes a text box for the user to enter the number of sides they want for their shape, and another text box for the user to choose a color for their shape. The program has buttons that allow the user to confirm their shape and color choices. The shapes are created using the JavaFX library, and the program includes code to handle user input and display the shapes and colors on the user interface.
